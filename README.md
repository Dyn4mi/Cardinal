## What can Cardinal do?

Anything, if you're creative! But Cardinal does come with some plugins to get you started...

* Fetching URL titles
* Google searches
* Weather report
* Now playing w/ Last.fm
* Reminders
* Urban Dictionary definitions
* Wikipedia definitions
* Stock ticker
* ... and more!

And Cardinal is still in development! But what makes Cardinaly truly special is the ease of adding new functionality.

## Basic Usage

### Configuration

Copy the `config.example.json` file to `config/config.json` (you can use another filename as well, such as `config.freenode.json` if you plan to run Cardinal on multiple networks).

At bare minimum, you should also add your nick and vhost to the `plugins/admin/config.json` file in the format `nick@vhost` in order to take advantage of admin-only commands (such as reloading plugins, telling Cardinal to join a channel, or blacklisting plugins within a channel).

### Running

Cardinal is run via a Docker container. To get started, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

After configuring Cardinal (see above), simply run `docker-compose up -d` if you are storing your config as `config/config.json`. Otherwise, you will need to create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file like so:

```yaml
version: "2.1"
services:
    cardinal:
        command: config/my_config_file.json
```

## Writing Plugins

Cardinal was designed with ease of development in mind.

```python
from cardinal.decorators import command, help

class HelloWorldPlugin(object):
    @command(['hello', 'hi'])
    @help("Responds to the user with a greeting.")
    @help("Syntax: .hello")
    def hello(self, cardinal, user, channel, msg):
        nick, ident, vhost = user
        cardinal.sendMsg(channel, "Hello {}!".format(nick))

def setup():
    return HelloWorldPlugin()
```
